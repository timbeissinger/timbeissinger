Tim Beissinger is a postdoc in the Plant Sciences Department at UC Davis.  He is currently researching linked selection during maize domestication. This research includes assessing changes in the historical population size of maize and the selective pressures that it experienced. The work has implications regarding the abundance of rare deleterious alleles in the maize genome. Previously, Tim studied artificially selected maize and chicken populations, and released a software package called GenWin that facilitates defining window boundaries for population-scale genomic analyses. Tim is passionate about using population and quantitative genetics to understand the evolution of domesticated species. He earned his PhD from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
